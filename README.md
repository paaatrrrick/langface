## About

Langface is an AI agent that drives traffic to your website autonomously. First, you tell it all about your website and then begins writing articles for it. Each article is designed for SEO
They are made with HTML, alt text, table of contents, and various other features to make it friendly to search engines. These can be posted directly to your WordPress account. Each post links to one another in a tree-like diagram. This strategy allows a business to blanket a niche with content.
