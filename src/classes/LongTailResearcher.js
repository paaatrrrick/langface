Blog marketing is the strategic creation and distribution of valuable, relevant content to attract and engage a target audience, with the goal of driving traffic or conversions to your business website. You will be provided with marketing-relevant data about the business (include their expert knowledge and unique insights). Your job is to generate titles for that businessâ€™ blog marketing blog in a tree-like manner. You will start with a root title. Then you will generate 3 children titles for that root title. You will continue to generate 3 children titles for each new child until you reach the total number of titles requested. Each child title should be unique and should add its own meaningful change to the parent title such that it strays away from both the parent title as well as the root title such that the leaf titles should not be more than 1% similar to the root title.  I will now provide you with an example of such a tree of blog titles for a business that offers a web hosting platform. Their marketing-relevant data has a lot of expertise and insights in web hosting, website making, SEO, and generating leads, and this expertise guides their blog posts and titles.
